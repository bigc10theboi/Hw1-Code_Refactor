# Hw1-Code_Refactor
In this exercise each memeber of the class produced our own repository and created a live site using starter code.
The starter code had some disorganized CSS styling so priority one was to clean that up by applying unique IDs to some elements while creating common classes allowing for more universal styling options across groups.
Upon cleaning up the style sheets the goal is to push the website live test out use of Github.
During this exercise everyone should have had to commit often and create proper systems of organization within the coding terminal and repsitory.
